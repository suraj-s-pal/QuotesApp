# QuotesApp

QuotesApp is an Android application that demonstrates the use of the ViewModel architecture component. It reads quotes from a JSON file, converts them to Java objects using Gson converter, and displays them in a card view. The app is developed using concepts such as ViewModel and ViewModelFactory to manage the UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way.
